\begin{abstract}
Multilingual acoustic modeling for improved automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been extensively researched. It's widely acknowledged that the shared-hidden-layer multilingual deep neural network (SHL-MDNN) acoustic model (AM) could outperform the conventional monolingual AM, due to its effectiveness in cross-lingual knowledge transfer. In this work, two research aspects are investigated, with the goal of improving multilingual acoustic modeling. Firstly, in the  SHL-MDNN architecture, the shared hidden layer configuration is replaced by a combined TDNN-BLSTM structure. Secondly, the improvement of cross-lingual knowledge transferability is achieved through adding the proposed language-dependent pre-final layer under each network output. The pre-final layer, rarely adopted in past works, is expected to increase nonlinear modeling capability between universal transformed features generated by shared hidden layers and language-specific outputs. Experiments are carried out with CUSENT, WSJ and RASC-863 corpora, covering Cantonese, English and Mandarin. A Cantonese ASR task is chosen for evaluation. Experimental results show that SHL-MTDNN-BLSTM achieves the best performance. The proposed additional language-dependent pre-final layer brings moderate while consistent performance gains in various multilingual training corpora settings, thus demonstrates its effectiveness in improving cross-lingual knowledge transferability.

\section{Introduction}
\label{Intro}
In recent years there has been a significant research interest in developing technologies for multilingual speech modeling, especially in the areas of acoustic modeling for  automatic speech recognition (ASR) \cite{Huang2013cross,ghoshal2013multilingual,karafiat2016multilingual,tong2017investigation,Zhou2017,ma2017improving}, keyword search \cite{ni2016rapid}, speech synthesis \cite{yu2016learning}, and speech emphasis detection \cite{ning2017learning}. One of the driving purposes is to enable cross-lingual knowledge transfer \cite{Huang2013cross}, as motivated by humans that it is very natural to learn a language by borrowing information from other language resources. While different languages have distinctive linguistic properties, speech sounds can be produced may have significant overlap, because the basic mechanism of speech production is largely language-independent.
Moreover, although large amounts of transcribed data for major languages like English or Mandarin are made commercially available nowadays \cite{paul1992design,li2004rasc863},
% nowadays people can easily obtain a large amount, like thousands of hours of transcribed speech data for major languages like English or Mandarin Chinese,
there are plenty of low-resource languages lacking  speech and linguistic resources. Multilingual modeling approaches
% could alleviate the data scarcity problem in acoustic \cite{Zhou2017,karafiat2016multilingual,yu2016learning} and language \cite{ragni2016multi} modeling for low-resource languages.
could  alleviate the data scarcity problem in low-resource acoustic \cite{Zhou2017,karafiat2016multilingual,yu2016learning} and language  \cite{ragni2016multi} modeling.

This work focuses on multilingual acoustic modeling, which aims at
% investigating on effective and elegant approaches to
exploiting out-of-domain language resources to  improve acoustic model (AM) for a target language.
% speech resources from other languages to improve ASR system performance in context-dependent deep neural network hidden Markov model (CD-DNN-HMM) framework \cite{dahl2012context}.
It has been widely acknowledged that multilingual acoustic modeling, especially in the context of deep neural network hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) \cite{dahl2012context},
% based acoustic modeling \cite{dahl2012context},
could reduce word error rate (WER) for ASR tasks compared with its monolingual counterpart \cite{Huang2013cross,ghoshal2013multilingual,karafiat2016multilingual,Zhou2017}. Basically, there are two methods in the  development of a multilingual DNN-HMM AM, namely, feature-based and model-based methods \cite{karafiat20172016,sercu2017network}.
% In literature, the use of multiple languages can be classified into two main directions,
For feature-based method, a bottleneck network is trained with multilingual corpora and used to  extract bottleneck features (BNFs) for a target language, followed by downstream DNN-HMM acoustic modeling.
% , where hidden layers including one bottleneck layer are shared among multiple languages while softmax output layers are language dependent.
% serves as a multilingual BN feature (BNF) extractor. BNFs of  the target language are extracted and used to train a DNN acoustic model.
% , followed by DNN acoustic model training.
For model-based method, multilingual resources are jointly employed to train a DNN-HMM AM, either sequentially \cite{ghoshal2013multilingual} or in parallel \cite{Huang2013cross}. The two methods could also be incorporated within one model \cite{karafiat20172016}.
 % to multilingual acoustic modeling.

% Among CD-DNN-HMM based multilingual training approaches,
The shared-hidden-layer multilingual DNN (SHL-MDNN) architecture, in which hidden layers are made common across many languages while the softmax layers are language dependent \cite{Huang2013cross}, is a milestone in the history of multilingual acoustic modeling. It enables joint optimization of DNN parameters by multiple languages simultaneously. The shared hidden layer architecture is regarded as a language-independent feature transform, which has been proved to work well for all languages involved during training \cite{Huang2013cross}.
In recent years, there were studies on combining SHL-MDNN with advanced machine learning techniques.
 % in recent years, as well as extended in combination with advanced machine learning techniques.
For example, Zhou et al. \cite{Zhou2017} replaced hidden layers of SHL-MDNN by long short-term memory (LSTM) with  residual learning, and achieved improvements in terms of  ASR performance.
Nevertheless, most researchers working on SHL-MDNN based architecture take it for granted, without doubting whether it is optimal in terms of cross-lingual knowledge transfer by sharing all hidden layers among multiple languages. Yosinski et al. \cite{yosinski2014transferable} made an investigation to quantify the transferability of each hidden layer in image classification tasks, and found out transfer learning from a base task to a target task achieves the best performance when hidden layers except the last layer are transfered, followed by adding one layer on top, and retraining by the target task.
Motivated by this, it natually raises a question  to us:
% Regardless of
% features generated by higher hidden layers tend to be more \emph{specific}  to a particular dataset or task compared to lower layer features, because they are closer to the output classification layer,
% Although this is slightly different from our problem as they train the network with multiple tasks sequentially while we employ multilingual data to train DNN in parallel, the concept of cross-task knowledge transfer is in common.
% It is unknown to us:
Will the SHL-MDNN AM perform better if we add one  language-dependent hidden layer before each block-softmax layer? To our best knowledge it is the first time the effectiveness of setting the language-dependent pre-final layer has been explicitly researched.

Time delay neural network (TDNN) \cite{peddinti2015time} and (bidirectional) LSTM recurrent neural network ((B)LSTM-RNN) \cite{sak2014long,graves2013hybrid} are structures able to capture long term temporal dependencies.
% A bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) \cite{graves2013hybrid} makes use of
% , which is able to make use of
% both previous and future context, and is a variant to LSTM.
Past works have shown their advantages over conventional structures such as Gaussian mixture model (GMM) or feed-forward neural network (FFNN)\footnote{\label{footnote:ffnn}FFNN structure will be denoted as \textit{DNN} without causing confusion.} on large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) \cite{peddinti2015time,sak2014long,graves2013hybrid}, as well as speaker \cite{zheng2015exploring} and language recognition \cite{qian2017improving}, probably due to their  ability to make use of longer contextual information.
Recently, network combination for further improving AMs
 % acoustic modeling
 has been actively investigated, especially the combination of TDNN and (B)LSTM \cite{chengexploration,smit2017aalto}. Cheng et al. \cite{chengexploration} found out that a network with interleaving layers of TDNN and LSTM (TDNN-LSTM)

\subsection{TDNN-BLSTM}
An LSTM network transforms an input sequence $\bm{x}=(\bm{x_1}, \ldots , \bm{x_T})$ to an output sequence $\bm{y}= (y_1, \ldots, y_T)$ by computing equations from $t=1$ to $T$ \cite{sak2014long}:
\begin{align}
i_t&=\sigma (W_{ix}\bm{x_t} + W_{ih}h_{t-1}+W_{ic}c_{t-1}+b_i),\\
f_t&=\sigma (W_{fx}\bm{x_t} + W_{fh}h_{t-1}+W_{fc}c_{t-1}+b_f), \\
c_t&=f_t \odot c_{t-1} + i_t \odot \tanh (W_{cx}\bm{x_t} + W_{ch}h_{t-1}+b_c),\\
o_t&=\sigma (W_{ox}\bm{x_t} + W_{oh}h_{t-1}+W_{oc}c_{t}+b_o), \\
h_t&= o_t \odot \tanh (c_t),\\
y_t&= \phi (W_{yh} h_t + b_y),
\end{align}
where $i_t, f_t, o_t, c_t, h_t$ are input gate, forget gate, output gate, cell activation and cell output activation vectors at time $t$, with the same size. $\odot$ is element-wise dot product, $\sigma$ is sigmoid function, $\phi$ is the network output activation function, often in the form of softmax. As a commonly used alternative in practice, projected LSTM (LSTMP) could reduce
% Projected LSTM (LSTMP) is a commonly used alternative, in order to reduce
computational complexity \cite{sak2014long}. With LSTMP structure, the equations above change slightly, the $h_t$ is replaced with $r_t$ and the following is added:
\begin{align}
r_t &= W_{rh}h_t, \\
y_t &= \phi (W_{yr}r_t + b_y),
\end{align}
where $r_t$ is recurrent projection.

The shortcoming of LSTMs lies in the fact that it could only make use of previous context information. A BLSTM network extends to exploiting both previous and future context information by constructing pairs of forward and backward LSTM layers together before network output \cite{graves2013hybrid}. (B)LSTM could be trained by a truncated backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm \cite{williams1990efficient}.

A TDNN network captures long term temporal dependencies, with training times comparable to vanilla DNNs \cite{peddinti2015time}.
% , which is computationally more efficient to (B)LSTM network.
Unlike DNNs, TDNN transforms are tied across time steps. A typical TDNN model is shown as in Figure \ref{fig:tdnn}. The input context to layer $2,3$ and $4$ are $\{-1,0,1\}, \{-1,1\}$ and $\{-2,2\}$. As can be seen that a higher layer could learn a wider range of temporal context.

\subsection{Feature extraction and alignment generation}

% In this work, the Kaldi speech recognition toolkit is used \cite{povey2011kaldi}.
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) without cepstral truncation are used as input features, i.e., $40$-dimensional MFCCs are computed at each time step \cite{povey2014parallel}. MFCCs are spliced with a specific  context size for a certain neural network as will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:baseline}, and further appended with $100$-dimensional i-vectors  to perform instantaneous speaker adaptation. The i-vectors are extracted in an online version,
% An online fashion of i-vector extraction is adopted,
where only frames prior to the current frame, including previous utterances of the same speaker, are used.
% In order to allow the i-vectors to supply the information about any mean offset of the speaker’s data
% These i-vectors have embedded information about the mean offset of speakers' data, so
% Cepstral normalization towards MFCCs is not
% necessary \cite{chengexploration}, thus not

A speed-perturbation method is used to augment training speech data three-fold, with speed factors of $0.9,1.0$ and $1.1$ \cite{ko2015audio}.

% This GMM-HMM is further used to produce frame alignment of speed-perturbed training data of its corresponding language.
% Syllable error rates (SERs) of GMM-HMM ASR systems for CA and MA are $8.38\%$ and $3.12\%$, WER of GMM-HMM system for EN is $7.97\%$.

It is worth noting that basic acoustic units defined for MA in this work are different from those for EN and CA. This is mainly because we hoped to facilitate this study by re-using previously developed GMM-HMM systems. In Mandarin, each character is pronounced as a monosyllable, which can be composed of an \emph{Initial} (onset) and a \emph{Final} (rime), according to Hanyu Pinyin System \cite{wiki-no_url:xxx}. \emph{Initials} and \emph{Finals} are adopted as the basic acoustic units for MA. For EN and CA, phone based acoustic units are adopted.
\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:exp}
% For Mandarin speech recognition, \textit{Initials} \emph{Initils}and \emph{Finals} are commonly used as the basic units for acoustic modeling \cite{lee2016automatic}.
\subsection{Baseline systems}
\label{sec:baseline}
Baseline systems include monolingual DNN, TDNN, BLSTM and TDNN-BLSTM, all trained with CUSENT training set. There are $300$ training utterances randomly selected as validation data, in order to prevent overfitting. These models are trained on a  cross-entropy criterion. For feature extraction and  acoustic modeling, we use Kaldi toolkit \cite{povey2011kaldi}.
% All these experiments are performed with CA training and test set.

DNN contains $6$ hidden layers with $1024$ neurons per layer, with ReLU activation and batch normalization (ReLU-batchnorm) \cite{ioffe2015batch}. Input MFCCs are spliced with $\pm 5$.
% In other baseline models, TDNN layers are all implemented with ReLU-batchnorm.
TDNN contains $5$ ReLU-batchnorm layers with $1024$ neurons per layer. BLSTM contains $4$ pairs of forward and backward LTSMP layers \cite{sak2014long}, with $1024$-dimensional cells and $256$-dimensional recurrent projections. TDNN-BLSTM is composed of TDNN and forward-backward LSTMP layers, where TDNN layer width is $1024$, LSTMP cell and recurrent projection dimensions are $1024$ and $256$, respectively. The temporal context configurations of TDNN and TDNN-BLSTM are summarized in Table \ref{tab:tdnn_related_config}.

For DNN and TDNN, the number of training epochs is $3$, learning rate starts from $1.5\times 10^{-2}$ to $1.5\times 10^{-3}$ with exponential decay, minibatch size is $256$. For BLSTM and TDNN-BLSTM models, the number of training epochs is $6$, minibatch size is $128$, learning rate starts from $3\times 10^{-3}$ to $3\times 10^{-4}$, also with exponential decay.
A dropout method is adopted during network training,
% all the baseline models
in order to improve generalization \cite{chengexploration}. Dropout probability $p(n)$ with respect to training iterations $n$ is  piece-wise linear, as described below,
\begin{equation}
    p(n)=
   \begin{cases}
   0.2 \times \frac{n}{N}, &\mbox{$0 \le n \le \frac{N}{2}$}\\
   0.2 \times (1-\frac{n}{N}), &\mbox{$\frac{N}{2} \le n \le N$}
   \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of iterations. Note that the choices of training hyperparameters and TDNN temporal contexts basically follow Kaldi default settings.

\subsection{Results and analyses}
For multilingual acoustic modeling, DNN, TDNN, BLSTM and TDNN-BLSTM  are implemented in the SHL-MDNN architecture. Layer configurations are set the same as in baseline monolingual models, plus the language-dependent pre-final layer as proposed in Section \ref{sec:prefinal}. The pre-final layer is implemented by ReLU-renorm in Kaldi \emph{nnet3} recipe, with $1024$ neurons. Learning rate and minibatch sizes for multilingual AM training are consistent with corresponding baseline model settings. The number of training epochs for DNN and TDNN is $2$, BLSTM and TDNN-BLSTM is $4$. The dropout probability is constant $0.1$ for forward-backward LSTMP layers, and $0$ for DNN or TDNN layers, as we find this to be optimal in multilingual acoustic modeling.
EN and/or MA are merged with CA to form various multilingual training corpora. Similar to baseline model training, for each corpus, there are $300$ training utterances randomly selected as validation set. Syllable error rates (SERs) of CA test set is chosen for evaluation. A syllable trigram language model trained with transcriptions of CA training data is used during decoding, using SRILM toolkit \cite{Stolcke02srilm--}. SERs of baseline and multilingual systems are listed in Table \ref{tab:mono_vs_multi}.

From Table \ref{tab:mono_vs_multi} and Figure \ref{fig:curve}, the following observations are made:
% \begin{itemize}

(1) Multilingual models of DNN, TDNN, BLSTM and TDNN-BLSTM using merged CA and EN corpora outperform their monolingually trained counterparts, with relative improvements ranging from $3.3\%$ to $11.3\%$. This result is generally in line with past works \cite{Huang2013cross,Zhou2017}.

(2) TDNN-BLSTM achieves the best Cantonese ASR performance among all neural network structures in both monolingual and multilingual training, with SERs $6.31\%$ and $5.50\%$, respectively. Moreover,
% validation data frame accuracy curve during multilingual TDNN-BLSTM training converges to a significantly higher value than that of TDNN. B
by observing frame accuracy curves, the generalization capability of the trained TDNN-BLSTM is stronger than TDNN.
% trained TDNN-BLSTM shows stronger generalization capability than TDNN.

%, except for a slight inferior to TDNN when using CA and MA datasets.
% The combined network, TDNN-BLSTM, has shown advantage over TDNN and BLSTM models in both monolingual and multilingual training strategies.
% By merging CA, EN and MA, TDNN-BLSTM model can yield a further gain to $5.59\%$, while TDNN model ($5.90\% \rightarrow 5.88\%$) does not show significant improvement.
(3) Compared with TDNN-BLSTM and TDNN,
 % trained with monolingual CA corpus and multilingual corpora,
it can be observed that the achieved  SER reduction from monolingual (CA) training to multilingual training is larger for TDNN-BLSTM than for TDNN.
% resulting from including multilingual training sets is larger for TDNN-BLSTM than for TDNN.
% TDNN-BLSTM achieves greater SER reduction  than TDNN in multilingual training than in monolingual case.
%the advantage of TDNN-BLSTM over TDNN increases when training languages increase.
This
% not only demonstrates our assumption that TDNN-BLSTM could bring improved ASR performance in multilingual acoustic model training, in comparison with other commonly adopted neural network structures, but also
shows the stronger modeling capability of TDNN-BLSTM as compared to TDNN, especially in the context of multilingual acoustic modeling. On the other hand, the model size of TDNN-BLSTM is significantly larger than TDNN, hence much more computational resources are required.
% requiring much more computational and memory resources.
% especially with larger variety of training languages and data size.
%\item[(d)] When trained with merged CA and MA datasets, both TDNN-BLSTM and TDNN perform less well as compared to those trained by CA and EN datasets, although they both outperform monolingual training baseline. As training data quantity of MA is larger than EN by about $29\%$, there is no reason to regard this issue as a data size problem. We suppose it is due to the different definition of basic acoustic units for MA, \emph{Initial-Final}. Further research is needed to investigate more on the influence caused by different acoustic unit definitions on multilingual neural network acoustic modeling.

\subsection{The effectiveness of the pre-final layer}
The effectiveness of language-dependent pre-final layer is of great interest to us. We report our experimental results based on SHL-MTDNN-BLSTM model with the optional pre-final layer. Various training language identities are adopted to train SHL-MTDNN-BLSTM, as illustrated in Table \ref{tab:PF_vs_no_PF}. CA test set is chosen for evaluation. Experimental results are summarized as in Table \ref{tab:PF_vs_no_PF}. Note that language weights listed in this Table are all optimized ones.
